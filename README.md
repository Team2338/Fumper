Fumper
======

Included Java code is intended to be run on Fumper (Gear It Forward's 2014 FRC robot).
This code is intended for two drivers (one base driver, one auxiliary).
This code is a translation from the competition code that used LabView. As competition is over,
autonomous code may or may not be translated into the Java code.

Robot code can be found in src/team/gif directory.
